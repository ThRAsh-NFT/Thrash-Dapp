The NFT collection will be launched in the **Rinkeby Testnet** (the test phase) and later on will be launched in the **Avalanche Mainnet** (the launch phase).

The NFT will be having different characteristics so that you won't be having just a normal NFT.

So what are you waiting for come join the **ThRAsh** community and become a member of the _"Hood"_.

_**Minting date will be updated later!**_
{% endhint %}

## :dart: Goal of the project

To make NFTs that are unique, limited and have value in the long run.

We also plan to expand this project by introducing new functions (will be announced in the future) to create the _"ThRAshverse"_ so that the **Hood** stays relevant till the end of time.
